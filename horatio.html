      <h3>Brief History</h3>
      <p>Taken from Wikipedia</p>
      <p>Vice-Admiral Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson, 1st Duke of Bronté, KB (29 September 1758 – 21 October 1805),
        also known simply as Admiral Nelson, was an English flag officer in the Royal Navy. His inspirational
        leadership, grasp of strategy, and unconventional tactics brought about a number of decisive British naval
        victories, particularly during the Napoleonic Wars. He was wounded in combat, losing sight in one eye in Corsica
        at the age of 35, and most of one arm in the unsuccessful attempt to conquer Santa Cruz de Tenerife when he was
        38. He was fatally shot in 1805 shortly before his victory at the Battle of Trafalgar which is often regarded as
        Britain's greatest naval victory.</p>
